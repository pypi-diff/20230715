 - End Conversation: The user does not want to continue the conversation, so end the call.
  
 As such, this agent can have a natural sales conversation with a prospect and behaves based on the conversation stage. Hence, this notebook demonstrates how we can use AI to automate sales development representatives activites, such as outbound sales calls.

 ## SalesGPT Roadmap
 
-- Knowledge base for products/services a Sales Agent can offer (so that LLM does not make it up)
-- Convert LLM Chains (linear workflow) to an Agent (decides what to do based on user's input)
-    - What tools should the agent have? (e.g., the ability to search the internet)
-    - Add the ability of Sales Agent to interact with AI plugins on your website (.well-known/ai-plugin.json)

 # :robot: SalesGPT - Your Context-Aware AI Sales Assistant
 
 This repo demonstrates an implementation of a **context-aware** AI Sales Assistant using LLMs.
 
 SalesGPT is context-aware, which means it can understand what section of a sales conversation it is in and act accordingly.
+Morever, SalesGPT has access to tools, such as your own pre-defined product knowledge base, significantly reducing hallucinations!
 
-We leverage the [`langchain`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) library in this implementation and are inspired by [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) architecture .
